## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

#### Access Control
- Role-based permissions using OpenZeppelin AccessControl
- Principle of least privilege
- Multi-signature for admin operations
- Time-locked critical functions

#### Anti-Manipulation
- Commit-reveal voting prevents vote following
- VRF ensures unpredictable juror selection
- Economic incentives align with honest behavior
- Slashing mechanism deters misconduct

#### Data Integrity
- Hash commitments for evidence
- Immutable dispute records
- Event logs for audit trails
- Off-chain encrypted storage

### Economic Security

#### Stake Requirements
- Minimum stake enforced for jurors
- Lock periods prevent quick exit
- Slashing for proven misconduct
- Reputation affects eligibility

#### Fee Structure
- Dispute fees prevent spam
- Appeal fees raise bar for frivolous appeals
- Fees fund protocol operation
- Transparent fee distribution

### Operational Security

#### Randomness
- Chainlink VRF for verifiable randomness
- Multiple confirmations required
- Cannot be predicted or manipulated
- Callback gas limits prevent DoS

#### Time Locks
- Enforced voting periods
- Evidence submission deadlines
- Appeal windows
- Prevents rushing decisions

## Known Limitations

### Trust Assumptions
- Chainlink VRF oracle honesty
- IPFS/Arweave data availability
- Ethereum/Optimism liveness
- Admin key security

### Potential Risks
- 51% juror collusion (mitigated by VRF)
- Sybil attacks on juror pool (mitigated by stake)
- Front-running (mitigated by commit-reveal)
- Gas price manipulation (L2 provides stability)

## Audit Status

QuillArbiter has not yet undergone professional security audit. We plan to:
- Conduct comprehensive internal review
- Engage professional auditors before mainnet
- Implement bug bounty program
- Continuous monitoring post-launch

## Best Practices for Users

### For Plaintiffs/Defendants
- Encrypt sensitive evidence
- Use strong evidence hashes
- Keep private keys secure
- Verify contract addresses
- Start with small disputes to test

### For Jurors
- Secure your staking wallet
- Use hardware wallet for large stakes
- Verify voting commitments
- Keep salt values private
- Monitor your reputation

### For Integrators
- Verify contract addresses
- Test on testnet first
- Handle all error cases
- Monitor events for status
- Implement proper access controls

## Security Checklist

Before mainnet deployment:
- [ ] Professional security audit
- [ ] Testnet battle-testing
- [ ] Bug bounty program
- [ ] Multi-sig admin setup
- [ ] Emergency pause mechanism
- [ ] Incident response plan
- [ ] Insurance/coverage
- [ ] Legal review

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be:
- Announced via official channels
- Deployed with time locks
- Backwards compatible when possible
- Thoroughly tested before deployment
